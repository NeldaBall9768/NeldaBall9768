## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a data scientist focused on developing and deploying deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. This project demonstrates practical implementations of state-of-the-art neural network architectures, along with the workflows and optimization strategies needed to bring these models from experimentation to real-world applications.

The core of this repository features a variety of model architectures, ranging from standard feedforward networks to more advanced designs like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs for sequence modeling, and Transformer-based models for natural language processing. Each model is structured for readability, modularity, and experimentation, making it easy to swap layers, modify hyperparameters, or adapt to new datasets.

Alongside model design, this project places strong emphasis on optimization techniques that improve training speed, accuracy, and generalization. Techniques such as early stopping, learning rate schedules, batch normalization, dropout, data augmentation, and transfer learning are integrated to ensure robust model performance. I also experiment with optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, and SGD, selecting the best fit for each task.

The repository follows a clean project workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization. TensorBoard and custom plotting scripts are used to monitor metrics, compare models, and interpret results. Code is organized into reusable modules, with clear directory structures for datasets, models, notebooks, and outputs.

Whether youâ€™re exploring deep learning fundamentals or building scalable ML pipelines, this repository offers practical, well-documented examples to accelerate your work with TensorFlow and Keras.
